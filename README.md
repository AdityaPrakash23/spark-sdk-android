# Particle (_formerly Spark_) Android Cloud SDK

## WARNING: This documentation is currently under heavy construction; some info here is not yet updated/corrected.

<!---
Android Cloud SDK
=======
-->

The Particle Android Cloud SDK enables Android apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Cloud. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use wrapper for Particle REST API. The Cloud SDK will allow you to:

- Get a list of instances of user's Particle devices
- Read variables from devices
- Invoke functions on devices
- Manage access tokens for the Particle Cloud
- Claim & unclaim devices for a user account
- *(Coming Soon)* Publish events from the mobile app and subscribe to events coming from devices


**Rebranding notice**

Spark recently rebranded as Particle!  Classes like `SparkCloud` and `SparkDevice` this will soon be replaced with `ParticleCloud` and `ParticleDevice`, _et al._


**Beta notice**

This SDK is still under development and is currently in beta.  Although it is tested and mostly API-stable, bugs and other issues may be present, and the API may be subject to change prior to leaving beta.  (See rebranding notice above.)


## Getting Started

The SDK is available as a gradle dependency via [JCenter](https://bintray.com/particle/android/cloud-sdk/).  See the [Installation](#android-cloud-sdk-installation) section for more details.  (spoiler: just add `compile 'io.particle:cloudsdk:0.1.2'` to your `build.gradle`)

You can also [download the SDK as a zip](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-android/archive/master.zip).

For some usage examples, check out [Usage](#android-cloud-sdk-usage) below, or play with the `example_app` module included here in the repo.

## Usage

**NOTE:** all SDK methods are intentionally implemented as synchronous, blocking calls, including network calls.  This blocking API avoids nested callbacks and other complexity, making it easy to write a series of synchronous calls while on a non-UI thread.  To spare developers some of the awkwardness of making async calls and returning results back to the UI thread, we have supplied the `Async` and `ApiWork` set of convenience classes, a purpose-built wrapper around `AsyncTask` for use with these APIs.  (See [Extras](#android-cloud-sdk-usage-extras) for more info on this.)


Cloud SDK usage mostly involves two main classes:

1. `SparkCloud`, a singleton which enables all basic cloud operations such as user authentication, retrieving a device list, claiming, etc.
2. `SparkDevice`, which represents an instance of a claimed device in the current user session. (WIP: clearly explain "session" or don't mention it at all)  Each instance enables device-specific operations: invoking functions, reading variables, and getting basic info about the device (name, version info, etc).

### Extras

(WIP) further explain usages for the utils?  Give examples?

The SDK also ships with a handful of helpful utility classes:

- Async.executeAsync: as mentioned above, this is a purpose-built wrapper around AsyncTask.  (WIP: improve docs here or, preferably, improve class-level javadoc and just refer people to that.)
- Toaster: Another boilerplate-killer util.  `Toast.makeToast(blah blah blah)` is absurd, when all you really wanted was an ultra-lightweight way to say "put this string on the screen for a sec".  `Toaster` makes this dream come true.
- EZ: Misc. shortcuts for killing boilerplate code, like Toaster, but which have no simple taxonomic classification
- Py: There's nothing Particle or Android specific about this, but it's worth calling out.  This class brings a little Python joy to your Java, like easy collection constructors and a Python-like _truthiness_ check (called `truthy()`).  Quick quiz: unless you have special, specific requirements, like thread safety or immutability, which `List` implementation do you use Every. Single. Time.?  It's `ArrayList`, isn't it?  `Py.java` embraces this fact and gives you `Py.list()`.  For further Pythonic happiness, use it like a static import, so you can just do `list()` the way you could in Python.  Also included here is `truthy()`, which, if you know Python, does exactly what you think.


Here are few examples for the most common use cases to get your started:

#### Logging in to the Particle cloud

```java
Async.executeAsync(SparkCloud.get(myView.getContext()), new Async.ApiWork<SparkCloud, Void>() {
        public void callApi (SparkCloud sparkCloud) throws SparkCloudException, IOException {
            sparkCloud.logIn("ido@particle.io","l33tp4ssw0rd");
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Void aVoid) {
            Toaster.l(myActivity.this, "Logged in");
            // start new activity...
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(SparkCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
            Toaster.l(myActicity.this, "Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
        }
});

```
---


#### Get a list of all devices

List the devices that belong to currently logged in user:

```java
Async.executeAsync(SparkCloud.get(v.getContext()), new Async.ApiWork<SparkCloud, List<SparkDevice>>() {

        public List<SparkDevice> callApi (SparkCloud sparkCloud) throws SparkCloudException, IOException {
            return sparkCloud.getDevices();
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(List<SparkDevice> devices) {
            for (SparkDevice device : devices) {
                if (device.getName().equals("myDevice")) {
                    doSomethingWithMyDevice(device);
                    return;
                }
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(SparkCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
            Toaster.l(myActicity.this, "Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
        }
});

```
---

#### Read a variable from a Particle device (Core/Photon)
Note: this example assumes that `myPhoton` is an active instance of `SparkDevice`, and the instance represents a device claimed by the current user.

```java
Async.executeAsync(sparkDevice, new Async.ApiWork<SparkDevice, Integer>() {

        public Integer callApi(SparkDevice sparkDevice) throws SparkCloudException, IOException {
            return sparkCloud.getVariable("myVariable");
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Integer value) {
            Toaster.s(MyActivity.this, "Room temp is " + value + " degrees.");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(SparkCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
            Toaster.l(MyActivity.this, "Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
        }
});
```
---

#### Call a function on a Particle device (Core/Photon)
Invoke a function on the device and pass a list of parameters to it, `resultCode` on the completion block will represent the returned result code of the function on the device

```java
Async.executeAsync(sparkDevice, new Async.ApiWork<SparkDevice, Integer>() {

        public Integer callApi(SparkDevice sparkDevice) throws SparkCloudException, IOException {
            return sparkCloud.callFunction("digitalwrite", list("D7", "1"));
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Integer value) {
            Toaster.s(MyActivity.this, "LED on D7 successfully turned on");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(SparkCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
        }
});
```
---

#### List device exposed functions and variables
Functions is just a list of names, variables is a dictionary in which keys are variable names and values are variable types:

```java
Map<String, Object> vars = sparkDevice.getVariables();
for (String name : vars.keySet()) {
    Log.i("SOME_TAG", String.format("variable '%s'='%s'", name, vars.get(name)));
}

for (String funcName : sparkDevice.getFunctions()) {
    Log.i("SOME_TAG", "Device has function: " + funcName);
}
```
---


#### Get an instance of a device
Get a device instance by its ID:

```java
Async.executeAsync(sparkCloud, new Async.ApiWork<SparkCloud, SparkDevice>() {

        public SparkDevice callApi(SparkCloud sparkCloud) throws SparkCloudException, IOException {
            return sparkCloud.getDevice("53fa73265066544b16208184");
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(SparkDevice device) {
            myDevice = device;
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(SparkCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
        }
});
```
---

#### Rename a device
```java
Async.executeAsync(sparkDevice, new Async.ApiWork<SparkDevice, Void>() {

        public Void callApi(SparkDevice sparkDevice) throws SparkCloudException, IOException {
            sparkDevice.setName("rocket_bubble");
            return null; // return "Void"
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Void v) {
            Log.i("SOME_TAG", "Rename succeeded");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(SparkCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", "Rename failed", e);
        }
});
```
---


#### Logout
Logs out the user, clearing the user session and access token

```java
SparkCloud.get(someContext).logOut()
```

### Additional reference
(WIP) include link to generated javadoc, or (better yet) find a better way to browse javadoc for an installed lib within Android Studio, and recommend using that.

For additional reference check out the [source code of SparkCloud](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-android/blob/master/cloudsdk/src/main/java/io/particle/android/sdk/cloud/SparkCloud.java) and [SparkDevice](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-android/blob/master/cloudsdk/src/main/java/io/particle/android/sdk/cloud/SparkDevice.java) for complete interface info.  Also, if you're working from Android Studio, you can get the javadoc for each method or class by putting the cursor over it and hitting `F1` (on OS X).


## Installation

The SDK is available through [JCenter](https://bintray.com/particle/android/cloud-sdk/).  To install the Android Cloud SDK in your project, add the following to your app module gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.particle:cloudsdk:0.1.2'
}
```

Also note that the SDK is only hosted on JCenter, but not Maven Central; on the off chance that you don't have it already, you should make sure that your top-level Gradle file contains the following:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```
